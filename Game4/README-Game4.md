## Gameplay Loop
1.  **Start:** The application launches into a Start Menu. Press `Enter` to begin.
2.  **Traverse:** The player automatically progresses through the world but must navigate physical obstacles.
3.  **Survive:** The player must dodge bees, jump over gaps, and avoid hazardous mushrooms while maintaining health.
4.  **Progress:** Reaching the end of Level 1 automatically transitions to Level 2 (increased difficulty).
5.  **Win:** Reaching the end of Level 2 triggers the Victory condition.  

## Goal / Objective
Reach the end of Level 2 without losing all health or falling to doom.

## Player Actions & Controls

### Basic Movement
* **Run:** `A` (Left) and `D` (Right)
* **Jump:** `Spacebar`
* **Sprint:** Hold `Left Shift` (or `W`) while moving.  
### Advanced Abilities (Input-Controlled)
* **Double Jump:** Press `Spacebar` again while in mid-air to perform a second jump.

### Special Actions  
1.  **Climb:** When overlapping a Tree Trunk, hold `W` (Up) or `S` (Down) to climb vertically.
2.  **Duck:** Hold `S` (or `Down Arrow`) to crouch. This shrinks the player's hitbox to dodge high-flying projectiles.
3.  **Drop-Through:** While holding `S` (Crouch), press `Spacebar` to fall through "thin" platforms to the area below.

### Power-Ups
* **Flight:** If the player collects a Butterfly (Flight Platform), they gain 4 seconds of free flight.
    * *Controls:* Hold `Space` to fly up, `S` to fly down.

## Levels & Threats

### Level Design
* **Level 1:** Introduces basic platforming, stationary mushroom hazards, and standard bee projectiles.
* **Level 2:** Increases difficulty with wider gaps, "Deadly" instant-kill platforms, disappearing platforms, and aggressive "Mean Bee" swarms.

### Projectile Threats
1.  **Standard Bee:** A straight-flying projectile that respawns periodically. Deals 1 damage.
2.  **Mean Bee (Swarm):** A faster, zig-zagging projectile found in Level 2. Deals 2 damage.

### Platform Perils
1.  **Hazardous (Non-Lethal):** Mushrooms. Touching these deals damage.
2.  **Deadly (Lethal):** Marked by Red Mushrooms. Touching these causes instant death (Game Over).
3.  **Dynamic (Disappearing):** Marked by Turquoise Mushrooms. These platforms vanish shortly after the player lands on them, requiring quick reflexes.   


## Known Issues:  
- Climbable trees are disabled
- Mulitple issues are being fixed in a newer version.
