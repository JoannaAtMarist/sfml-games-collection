## Gameplay Loop  
- Time starts ticking down from a fixed amount.  
- The player moves left, right, or hops to collect falling pumpkin candies.  
- Each candy collected increases score and adds bonus time.  
- Bats fly across the screen and end the game on contact.  
- Ghosts drop down and steal candy (reducing score) if touched.  
- The loop continues until the timer runs out or the cat is caught by a bat.


## Goal/Objective  
Fly as long as possible, keep your score high, and maintain bubbling in the cauldron before time runs out.


## List of Player Actions
1. **Move Left** – arrow key ←  
2. **Move Right** – arrow key →  
3. **Hop** – spacebar (temporary jump to dodge bat or reach candy) 

## List of Hazards/Threats
- **Bat**: Flies horizontally across the screen at random heights and speeds.  
  - Contact with a bat results in instant death.  
- **Ghost**: Drops vertically from the top of the screen.  
  - Contact with a ghost reduces the player’s score (but does not end the game).
